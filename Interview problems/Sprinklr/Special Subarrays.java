/*
You are given an array Arr of size N consisting of non-negative integers. Find the number of subarrays of Arr, which are special.

A subarray is called special if it satisfies the following condition:
 1. The product of max and min element of teh subarray is divisible by the length of teh subarray.

Find the number of special subarrays of array Arr.

Input Format:
T - number of test cases
Each test will have
1. Size of array in line 1
2. Elements of array in line 2

Constraints:

1<=T<=10^3
1<=N<=5*10^4
0<=Arr[i]<=30

Example:
2
