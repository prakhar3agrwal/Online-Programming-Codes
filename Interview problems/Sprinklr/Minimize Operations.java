/*
Consider a weighted tree with N nodes and N-1 edges. You have the option to select an edge and adjust its weight by either increasing or decreasing
it by 1 in a single operation. There are Q queries given, each consists of 2 nodes U and V. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations
required to make the weight of every edge on the path from U to V equal.

Please note that if U and V are identical, no operations need to be performed.

Task:
You need to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to equalize the weight  of each edge on the path from node U to node V for every query.

Eaxmple:
N = 3,
Edges = [{1,2,3}, {1,3,2}]
Q = 1
Queries = [{2,3}]
Ans = 1 (increase the weight of the edge from 1 to 3 by 1, therefore the weight of all the edges on the path from 2 to 3 would become the same in 1 operation.

Constaints:
1<=N<=10^5
1<=Edges[i][0]<=N
1<=Edges[i][1]<=N
1<=Edges[i][2]<=26
1<=Q<=10^5
1<=Queries[i][0]<=N
1<=Queries[i][1]<=N
