/*
Problem Description
You are given two positive numbers A and B . You need to find the maximum valued integer X such that:

X divides A i.e. A % X = 0
X and B are co-prime i.e. gcd(X, B) = 1

Problem Constraints
1 <= A, B <= 109

Input Format
First argument is an integer A.
Second argument is an integer B.

Output Format
Return an integer maximum value of X as descibed above.

Example Input
Input 1:
 A = 30
 B = 12
 
Input 2:
 A = 5
 B = 10

Example Output
Output 1:
5

Output 2:
1

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 All divisors of A are (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30). 
 The maximum value is 5 such that A%5 == 0 and gcd(5,12) = 1
Explanation 2:

 1 is the only value such that A%5 == 0 and gcd(1,10) = 1
