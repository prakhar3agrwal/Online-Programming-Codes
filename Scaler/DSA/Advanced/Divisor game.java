/*
Problem Description
Scooby has 3 three integers A, B, and C.
Scooby calls a positive integer special if it is divisible by B and it is divisible by C. You need to tell the number of special integers less than or equal to A.

Problem Constraints
1 <= A, B, C <= 109

Input Format
First argument is a positive integer A
Second argument is a positive integer B
Third argument is a positive integer C

Output Format
One integer corresponding to the number of special integers less than or equal to A.

Example Input
Input 1:
 A = 12
 B = 3
 C = 2

Input 2:
 A = 6
 B = 1
 C = 4

Example Output
Output 1:
2

Output 2:
1

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 The two integers divisible by 2 and 3 and less than or equal to 12 are 6,12.
Explanation 2:

 Only 4 is a positive integer less than equal to 6 which is divisible by 1 and 4.
