Problem Description
Given an array of integers A of size N that is a permutation of [0, 1, 2, ..., (N-1)].
It is allowed to swap any two elements (not necessarily consecutive).
Find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array in ascending order.


Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 100000
0 <= A[i] < N

Input Format
The only argument given is the integer array A.

Output Format
Return the minimum number of swaps.

Example Input
Input 1:
A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 0]

Input 2:
A = [2, 0, 1, 3]

Example Output
Output 1:
4

Output 2:
2

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
There are many ways, to make the array sorted, 
One of the sequence of swaps as follow: 
    Initial array   ->   [1, 2, 3, 4, 0]
 swapping (1, 2) becomes [2, 1, 3, 4, 0]
 swapping (2, 3) becomes [3, 1, 2, 4, 0]
 swapping (4, 0) becomes [3, 1, 2, 0, 4]
 swapping (3, 0) becomes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. 
Thus the array is sorted in 4 swaps.  It cannot be sorted inlesser than 4 swaps.  


Explanation 2:
One of the sequence of swaps as follow: 
    Initial array  ->    [2, 0, 1, 3]
 swapping (2, 0) becomes [0, 2, 1, 3]
 swapping (1, 2) becomes [0, 1, 2, 3].
 
Thus the array is sorted in 2 swaps. It cannot be sorted in lesser than 4 swaps.

                A[i] = A[t];
                A[t] = t;
